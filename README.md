In the age of social media, bullying has become more anonymous as anyone can participate in cyberbullying without repurcussions, making this form of bullying harder to identify and stop.

The dataset is a set of 47,000 "tweets" from the popular social media app Twitter. In this notebook, we try to classify the tweets as related to one of 6 categories:

* Age
* Ethnicity
* Gender
* Religion
* Other
* Not cyberbullying
